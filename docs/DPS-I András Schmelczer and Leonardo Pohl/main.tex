\begin{abstract}
    An essential part of modern computing systems is the evaluation of their functionality. In their 2010 paper \cite{ds}, Zaharia et al. introduced a new scheduling paradigm that was to be used for large cluster computing systems. In this report, we will look at what the authors achieved and what experiments they conducted to ensure their achievements validity. Furthermore, we will reproduce one of their experiments and evaluate the differences that occurred. We concluded that the authors did an excellent job with the experiments: many were conducted, and the authors reasoned about the experiments and their results professionally.
